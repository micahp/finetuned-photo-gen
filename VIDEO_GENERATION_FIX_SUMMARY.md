# Video Generation Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Request Parsing & Validation
- **Issue**: `parseInt(undefined)` causing NaN values when form fields were missing
- **Fix**: Added safe parsing with fallbacks for `duration`, `fps`, and `motionLevel`
- **Impact**: Prevents validation errors from missing UI fields

### 2. Duration Validation
- **Issue**: Models accept only specific duration values (e.g., 5s, 10s) but API didn't validate
- **Fix**: Added validation against `model.durationOptions` before sending to Fal.ai
- **Impact**: Prevents 400 errors from Fal.ai API

### 3. Duplicate Credit Charging
- **Issue**: Credits were deducted twice - once for processing jobs, once for completed jobs
- **Fix**: Moved credit deduction to happen once before video generation
- **Impact**: Users no longer double-charged for video generation

### 4. Job Status Handling
- **Issue**: Custom job IDs (sync generations) were marked as "failed" during polling
- **Fix**: Updated `getJobStatus` to handle custom IDs properly
- **Impact**: Sync video generations no longer show as failed in UI

### 5. Route Parameter Types
- **Issue**: Status route used `Promise<{ jobId: string }>` incorrectly
- **Fix**: Changed to correct `{ jobId: string }` type
- **Impact**: Removes unnecessary async await in route handler

### 6. Fal.ai API Error Handling
- **Issue**: API call failures were swallowed, returning generic errors
- **Fix**: Added try/catch blocks around `fal.subscribe` and `fal.run` calls
- **Impact**: Better error messages when Fal.ai API calls fail

### 7. Seedance Model Improvements
- **Issue**: Aspect ratio not sent to text-to-video Seedance models
- **Fix**: Added `aspect_ratio` parameter for text-to-video requests
- **Impact**: Proper aspect ratio support for Seedance models

### 8. Logging Fixes
- **Issue**: Duration field in logs showed FPS value instead of actual duration
- **Fix**: Corrected logging to show proper duration value
- **Impact**: Clearer debugging information

### 9. Cloud Storage Error Handling
- **Issue**: Upload failures weren't properly checked, could result in expired temp URLs
- **Fix**: Added success validation for cloud storage uploads
- **Impact**: Ensures videos are properly stored before completing generation

## Environment Variables Required

For production deployment, ensure these variables are set:

```env
# Fal.ai Configuration
FAL_API_TOKEN=your_fal_api_token
FAL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com/api/fal/webhooks  # Optional for async

# Cloudflare R2 Storage
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT=your_r2_endpoint
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET=your_r2_bucket
CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL=your_r2_public_url  # Optional

# Optional: Dynamic Pricing
VIDEO_PRICING_MULTIPLIER=1.0  # Global multiplier
VIDEO_MODEL_SEEDANCE_LITE_IMAGE_COST=18  # Per-model override
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test image-to-video generation** with Seedance Lite model
2. **Test text-to-video generation** with proper prompts
3. **Verify credit deduction** happens only once
4. **Test status polling** for both sync and async generations
5. **Test error handling** with invalid parameters

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these fixes to production
2. Test with real video generation requests
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider adding integration tests for video generation flow
